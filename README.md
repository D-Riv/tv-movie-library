# Description

This is a movie and tv show library built with React. The data is fetched from an api I built in the backened.[ Repo for my api can be found here.](https://github.com/D-Riv/tv-movie-api) You have the ability to search for a movie or show of your choosing to view and get information of that particular movie or show. If you dont see one you like in the library you have the ability to add, edit, or delete a movie or show from the database as well. Overall the library contains full CRUD utilizing fetch request to reach different endpoints. This was an exciting yet challenging project to build.
